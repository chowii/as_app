        <h1>Help with your Sleep Tracker(s)</h1>
        <p>If you have purchased your Sleepsense with sleep tracking, your mattress should come with built in sensors - these are the USB cables exiting your mattress.</p>
        <p>If you have a single mattress you should have one built-in sensor, with one USB cord hanging out of your mattress. If you have a double, queen, king, or split king, you should have two built-in sensors, with two USB cords hanging out.</p>
        <h1>Having trouble connecting to the app?</h1>
        <p>Follow the steps below if youâ€™re having trouble connecting to your built in sleep tracker(s) via the Sleepsense app.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check that your mattress has the right number of USB cords protruding from it (if you have a Single mattress there should be one, if you have a Double, Queen, King, or Split King, there should be two)</li>
            <li>Ensure the USB cord(s) are plugged into the nearest power outlet</li>
            <li>On your phone or tablet, check that Bluetooth is turned on and Airplane mode is turned off</li>
            <li>Go back to the app</li>
            <li>Make sure your phone is near to your mattress and that there are no physical obstacles (including yourself) standing between your phone and the mattress</li>
            <li>Try connecting again</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you've tried the above steps and are still having trouble, please contact support on 1300 654 000 and our customer care team will be happy to help.</p>
