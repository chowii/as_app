        <h1>Help with your Adjustable Comfort System (Mattress Pump)</h1>
        <p>The Adjustable Comfort System (ACS) is the pump that controls the airflow to your mattress. For it to work it needs to be connected to three things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A power outlet</li>
            <li>The air hose(s) of your mattress</li>
            <li>The Bluetooth on your phone or tablet (if you’re using the Sleepsense app)</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Having trouble connecting to the app?</h1>
        <p>Follow the steps below if you’re having trouble connecting to your mattress pump via the Sleepsense app.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check that it is plugged securely into a power outlet</li>
            <li>A blue light should flash for a few seconds to the left of where the power cord connects to the pump</li>
            <li>If the blue light does not turn on, there may be a fault with the pump. Please call support.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you've followed the above steps and the blue light turns on but the app still won't connect to the pump, try checking the Bluetooth connection on your phone.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure Airplane Mode is not on</li>
            <li>Go to your phone's settings</li>
            <li>Go to 'Bluetooth'</li>
            <li>Ensure Bluetooth is turned on</li>
            <li>Go back to the app</li>
            <li>Make sure your phone is no further than 1 metre away from the pump and that there are no physical obstacles (including yourself) standing between your phone and the pump</li>
            <li>Try connecting again</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you've tried the above steps and are still having trouble, please contact support on 1300 654 000 and our customer care team will be happy to help.</p>
